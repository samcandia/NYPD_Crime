# NYPD Crime Group Project

## Module 16-17

### This project was a collaboration between Samantha Candia, Erica Morales, Javier Beltran, and Amy Ownby

For this project, we created a set of visualizations based on a crime dataset in New York City. We pulled the data from this source:
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-complaint-data-current-year-to-date

We chose to focus on a crime dataset in New York City. We specifically looked at the year 2023 and analyzed the data to answer some questions and make our visualizations. Diving into the data, we looked at the five specific boroughs of New York City. We aimed to find out where crime occurred the most and where, if crime increased or decreased over the 12 months, and which crimes occurred the most.

For the interactive map, we listed the top 3 crimes and when you toggle over a dot, it tells you the specific information about a particular crime. We also included a line graph, two bar charts comparing misdemeanors vs felonies using seaborn, and a heat map.

We utilized ChatGPT, past assignments, and google searches for help with our code.
